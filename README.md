Currently, he is working with Dr. Andr√© Punt (UW SAFS) and Dr. Lewis Barnett (NOAA AFSC) to develop a framework for designing efficient and flexible fishery-independent surveys for the eastern and northern Bering Sea to address the challenges of limited resources and shifting species distributions. Daniel earned an MS in Oceanography and Marine Management from the University of Barcelona in 2016. After that, he started working as a research assistant at the Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM-CSIC) and the Ecopath International Initiative (Barcelona, Spain) where he took part in species distribution and ecosystem modeling groups in collaboration with Dr. Marta Coll. In 2022, he earned his PhD in Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences at the University of Florida under the supervision of Dr. David Chagaris. During his PhD, he focused on spatiotemporal ecosystem dynamics on the West Florida Shelf with emphasis on red tides.
